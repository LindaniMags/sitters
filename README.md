# Installation and Usage
### Installation:
First install all the dependencies in the file 'requirements.txt'. You can then start the app by running the 'run.py' file.

### Usage:
This app is meant to be a brochure app where clients can get in contact with service providers. After finding the desired service, location
and other desired attributes. The client can easily contact the service provider with the provided contact details.

## Inspiration:
I once moved to a completely new town where I did not know anyone so I had a very hard time finding a
babysitter for my kid. I saw that if I had such a struggle then there must be more people who suffer the same. Not just babysitting,
but other chores  or errands that someone might need help with. This is how the idea of the project came about.
A single place where one can find all the help they may need. Anytime!

### Process and Collaboration
I started of with the functionality of the whole app as it was the harder part,
I then followed on with css after having the app run as desired. I managed to stay on schedule with the timeline that was provided by the school.
As I was working alone on this project, I sought help from my fellow students on Discord who were very helpful
Noah helped me with the right screen recording software and Ismail had some good suggestions about the technologies I can use.

ENJOY!!!ðŸ¤©
